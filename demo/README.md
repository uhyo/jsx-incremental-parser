# jsx-incremental-parser — live demo

An interactive playground for [`jsx-incremental-parser`](../). It streams a JSX
string into the parser **a few characters at a time** (the way an LLM streams
tokens) and renders the resulting **live React tree** side-by-side with the raw
text. Everything that hasn't arrived yet is the single `<Pending />` frontier,
shown here as a shimmer.

The layout is two side-by-side panes: the **received stream** (raw text, growing
with a blinking caret) on the left, and the **live React tree** it parses into on
the right.

## What it shows

- **Incremental rendering** — settled subtrees stay put while only the open path
  and the `<Pending />` shimmer update each chunk.
- **The single frontier** — exactly one shimmer at a time, nested in the
  innermost open element.
- **Lenient parsing** — the "Malformed" sample omits close tags and uses an
  unsupported `{ }` expression; the parser recovers and reports via `onError`
  instead of throwing.
- **Components as an allowlist** — only the components in
  [`src/components.tsx`](./src/components.tsx) can be instantiated by the streamed
  JSX; anything else degrades to `<Pending />`.

## Run it

The demo imports the library straight from `../src` via a Vite alias, so there's
no build step — edits to the library show up live.

```sh
cd demo
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then open the printed URL. Pick a sample (or edit the JSX), choose a speed, and
press **Stream it**.

## Deploy (Cloudflare Workers)

The demo is a fully static SPA, so it ships as an
[assets-only Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/):
Cloudflare serves the built `dist/` directly, with no Worker script. The config
lives in [`wrangler.jsonc`](./wrangler.jsonc) (`not_found_handling:
"single-page-application"` rewrites unknown paths to `index.html`).

One-time auth (either works):

```sh
pnpm exec wrangler login            # interactive OAuth, or…
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=…       # token with "Edit Workers" permission
```

Then build + publish:

```sh
cd demo
pnpm install
pnpm run deploy                     # = vite build && wrangler deploy
```

Wrangler prints the live URL (`https://jsx-incremental-parser-demo.<account>.workers.dev`).
To preview the production build on the Workers runtime locally first, run
`pnpm cf:preview` (`vite build && wrangler dev`).

## How it's wired

```tsx
import { useIncrementalJsx } from "jsx-incremental-parser/react";

const node = useIncrementalJsx(stream, {
  components: demoComponents,      // allowlist + renderers
  Pending: Shimmer,               // frontier placeholder
  onUnknownComponent: "pending",
  onError: (err) => { /* surfaced in the UI */ },
});
```

The streamed source is a `ReadableStream<Uint8Array>` built in
[`src/streaming.ts`](./src/streaming.ts), which releases the text in small chunks
on a timer and encodes to bytes — deliberately exercising the library's
streaming `TextDecoder` path.

> The demo intentionally does **not** wrap the tree in `<StrictMode>`: a stream
> source is single-use, and StrictMode's dev double-invocation would consume it
> before the real run. The library is StrictMode-safe given a *stable* source.
